# What is Java Crawl
Java Crawl is a simple turn-based dungeon crawler made almost exclusively in Java. 
It's a little old-school and somewhat outdated in terms of today's standards, but it should kill some time.
# Whoami
I'm your average computer science student. Not incredibly clever or talented, but I like Java quite a bit. 
I should probably expand my horizons with the projects I post here on github...
# The Plan for Java Crawl
I want this to a be a project that I actually finish and therefore I've set rather realistic goals. 
If I'm still motivated to work on it, then I'll add the features that are a part of my long-term plan. 
If not, well I've finished something that functions rather well and other people should be able to use it as a solid foundation to make their own text-based RPG.
# Can I Use Your Code
I'd be flattered if you did since I'm a pretty mediocre programmer. You don't need to credit me either, just show me what you're making!
# Keeping Up to Date With My Project
This project idea has been rehashed by so many people and there are probably a multitude of better examples than this one, but if you'd like to keep up to date
with my progress, you can take a look at my trello board:
